title:  "DIY Airlock Fermentation Lid"
---

Last fall, I discovered sauerkraut fermentation as a hobby.  What can I say?  I know a good trend when I see one.  Like any hobby worth its salt, there are toys to buy.  And lots of recommendations.  For my first batch of sauerkraut last year, I started with a beautiful, sensual, weighty [1-gallon stoneware crock][1] from Ohio Stoneware.  I was inspired to use the crock after watching a youtube video, [German Sauerkraut Making - Authentic Method][2].  I followed the video's instructions and make a decent first batch.

For my next round of sauerkraut, I was curious to try a method involving an airlock.  I had heard that airlocks can improve flavor and consistency while avoiding the dreaded white mold.  Here are two sources of information that I liked:

- [Fermentation Equipment, Part 1: Airlocks][3].
- [Mark Frauenfelder's Go-To Sauerkraut][4].

These sources recommend the [Pickl-it][5] and [The Pickle Meister][6] fermentation jars.  These jars seem to be canning jars with a homebrewing airlock thrown on top.  Since I have loads of ball jars at home, I thought it would be nice to just buy the top with the airlock.  A quick search on amazon turns up several types of these.  Two examples:

- [Pickle-Pro vegetable Fermenting Lid][7].  ~$20 with shipping.
- [Kraut Kap - Platinum][8].  ~$14 with shipping.

After seeing these, I thought it would be fun, easy, and inexpensive to make my own.  All I needed was a [Ball Plastic Storage Cap][9] ($4 for 8) or a [Tattler Reusable Wide Mouth Canning Lid][10] ($12 for 12), a [3 Piece Plastic Airlock][11] ($6.15 for 3), and a [rubber grommet][15].  I had a ball jar lid lying around.  I drove to [Vermont Homebrew Supply][12] and bought an airlock and gasket (the large size) for less that $2.00.  I drilled a hole in the lid with a 1/2 inch bit (though a 7/16 bit might have been a better fit for the airlock stem) and installed the gasket.  Then I inserted the airlock.  Done.  5 minutes of work.  I think I could easily make 10 of these in 20 minutes if I got my rhythm.
